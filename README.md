This project focuses on designing a Cloth Folding Machine, aimed at automating the tedious task of folding clothes efficiently. The machine was conceptualized and built using advanced skills in 3D modeling, 3D printing, and Autodesk Inventor. The use of 3D modeling allowed for precise design and simulation of the machine's components, ensuring functionality and accuracy. Autodesk Inventor played a crucial role in visualizing the mechanical parts and ensuring seamless integration before moving into the physical prototyping phase, which was executed through 3D printing to create a functional, cost-effective model. The result is an innovative solution for simplifying garment folding in both domestic and commercial environments.
